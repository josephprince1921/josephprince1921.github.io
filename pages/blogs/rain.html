        Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from
        atmospheric water vapor and then become heavy enough to fall under
        gravity. Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible
        for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth. It provides
        suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as water for
        hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation.
        <br />
        <br />
        The major cause of rain production is moisture moving along
        three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as
        weather fronts. If enough moisture and upward motion is present,
        precipitation falls from convective clouds (those with strong upward
        vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can
        organize into narrow rainbands. In mountainous areas, heavy
        precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within
        windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to
        condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains. On the
        leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air
        caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air
        mass. The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence
        zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes.

        <br />
        The urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall, both in
        amounts and intensity, downwind of cities. Global warming is also
        causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally, including wetter
        conditions across eastern North America and drier conditions in the
        tropics. Antarctica is the driest continent. The globally averaged
        annual precipitation over land is 715 mm (28.1 in), but over the whole
        Earth it is much higher at 990 mm (39 in).[1] Climate classification
        systems such as the Köppen classification system use average annual
        rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes.
        Rainfall is measured using rain gauges. Rainfall amounts can be
        estimated by weather radar.
